## Convolution Classifier

This repository contains code for building an image classifier using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The goal of this classifier is to classify images of cars and trucks.

The classifier is built using transfer learning, which means that a pre-trained model is used as the base for feature extraction. In this case, the InceptionV1 model (also known as GoogLeNet) pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset is used as the base. The head of the classifier consists of two dense layers.

The code is written in Python using the TensorFlow library. The classifier is trained using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss function, and evaluated using binary accuracy.

Understanding convolutional neural networks and transfer learning is important in the field of data science, particularly for image classification tasks. By using pre-trained models as the base for feature extraction, we can leverage the vast amount of knowledge already learned from previous tasks, resulting in faster and more accurate models. This can have significant benefits in various industries, including healthcare, manufacturing, and automotive.

This repository serves as a useful starting point for those interested in building their own image classifiers using convolutional neural networks and transfer learning.
